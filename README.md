DataAnnotation - Hidden Message Challenge

The idea is to be able to read a text file containing a set of desending numbers and random character string. Once read a hidden message should be revealed. 

Example: In text file

    1 I
    2 Bark
    3 Love
    4 Elephant
    5 You
    6 Trees

Program will decifer the message by printing out each numbers like nodes of a graph. It will read only the nodes that are to the most right of the graph.

Example: Output

      1
     2 3 
    4 5 6

End result should be "I Iove Trees"

Example: Output

    I Love Trees

Extra added:
- Sort if list contain random numbers
